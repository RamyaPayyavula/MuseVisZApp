# MuseVisZApp
Our novel IoT-based VRLE application is used to monitor student EEG signal as they participate in different learning activities and, updates their responses in terms of emotions, which also appears as real-time visualization on the teacher's dashboard. This can help the teacher to keep track of all the students' brain signals as they are participating in the learning material, and accordingly give feedback, modify the content delivery and so on. Our edge application is essentially a Social Virtual Reality (VR) platform that collects EEG data from each student EEG sensor using EEG headbands like Emotiv [2] or Muse [3], feeds the data to the public cloud, updates the social portal and then provides visualization features for their response to the teacher.
